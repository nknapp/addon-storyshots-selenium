# How it works

Taking a screenshot of the correct size is not easy (as I had to find out), because decorations
have different sizes in different browsers, and some browsers have a minimal window-size.

"{{package.name}}" uses an iframe to simulate the browser window. The workflow for screenshots in
multiple window sizes is the following:

* Open `about:blank`
* Insert an iframe, loading the storybook-story.
* Execute hook "beforeFirstScreenshot", which by default waits a couple of seconds to let the
  page load completely.
* Resize the iframe to the first specified width and height, execute "beforeEachScreenshot", take a screenshot
  and compare.
* Resize the iframe to the specified width and height, execute "beforeEachScreenshot", take a screenshot
and compare.
* and so on...

This process is executed in parallel for each browser. The selenium-drivers are initialized before
all tests and closed afterwards.
