# Overview / Purpose

"{{package.name}}" is a plugin for Storybook's "storyshot" addons that allows you to
visually compare your stories in multiple browsers and multiple screen sizes. What?

* [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) helps you structure your UI components. You can develop
  components independently of the whole app, and describe them in "stories". Each story is
  small web-page that shows your component in a certain state. It's pretty cool...

* [Storyshots](https://storybook.js.org/docs/testing/structural-testing/) is an add-on to storybook.
  It allows you to take snapshots of each of your stories and compare them to old versions.
  The test ensures that they do not change and if they do, you can verify if the change is wanted
  or not.

By default, StoryShots uses [React Tree Snapshots](https://jestjs.io/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html).
Using "{{package.name}}", you can take screenshots of your components using browser remote controlled via
[Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/). Those screenshots are visually compared to a baseline-screenshot
using the package {{npm "jest-image-snapshot"}}. Differences lead to a failing test and the difference
will be added as an image-file (which can be added to your CI's artifacts).

"{{package.name}}" also allows you to test responsive components by specifying multiple screen sizes. It also
allows you to specify multiple browsers.

You can setup a Selenium grid yourself, use a [docker-image](https://github.com/containerize-my-server/docker-image-selenium-with-tunnel)
or rent services like [BrowserStack](https://browserstack.com) or [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/).

> At this point, I should mention that BrowserStack provided a free account to me
> very quickly, so that I could automated tests for this component using BrowserStack.
> I am not anyhow affiliated with BrowserStack however.
