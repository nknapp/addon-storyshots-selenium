# Usage

The integration-tests in this repository are a good example for how to setup tests using this repository.

* The [docker-selenium integration test](integration-tests/docker-selenium.test.ts) uses the docker-image
  [docker-image](https://github.com/containerize-my-server/docker-image-selenium-with-tunnel) to
  start a selenium grid. It is based upon
  [elgalu/docker-selenium](https://github.com/elgalu/docker-selenium) but includes a "reverse-tunnel"
  that can be used to access the storybook-server on the host, or on the "build-container" in
  Gitlab-CI.
* The [BrowerStack integration test](integration-tests/browserstack.test.ts-snapshots) uses
  BrowserStack-Automate to create screenshots. It starts a BrowserStackLocal-Tunnel to give
  BrowserStack access to your local server.
* You can also have a look at the [Github-Actions](.github/workflows/node.js.yml) configuration
  for running the tests, especially at the artifacts definition, that allows you to
  inspect test-results that have failed in CI.

I am planning to provide real example repositories at some point, also for "Gitlab-CI".
